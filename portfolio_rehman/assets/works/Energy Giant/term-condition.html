                <li>
                  <p>The Company works hard to ensure the delivery of goods. Notwithstanding this, the customer accepts that sometimes delivery issues occur and this does not give cause for cancellation.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The customer is responsible for keeping any equipment secure and dry once delivered. If equipment is damaged, removed or packaging opened then the customer will be liable for any costs or losses incurred by both themselves and the Company. These costs include both the cost of replacing equipment and the cost of labour (either extra labour employed to rectify the problem or wasted due to equipment being missing).</p>

The risk of any of the existing system failing once the new equipment is installed is solely the responsibility of the customer.

                <li>
                  <p>You will need to provide free access to and from the installation property on the agreed dates so that we can deliver and install equipment. You must also provide free access to water, gas and electricity for installing and testing your new equipment.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>During the fulfilment of this contract, the customer agrees to provide a safe and respectful workplace for any persons attending the installation address. Persons attending a property to carry out work connected with this contract will leave the property if rude, abusive or unsafe conditions are encountered. If this happens, it will be at the sole discretion of the Company if a reattendance is arranged and what the charge for such a reattendance will be. In any event, no refund will be due from the Company to the customer if the site is vacated for reasons of safety, abuse or general rudeness.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Prior to any attendance by the Company, it is the customer's responsibility to secure any permissions, licences or permits that may be required to authorise the work. An example of such permit could be a listed building consent, landlord consent or freeholder agreement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Whilst all reasonable care will be taken by the Company, it accepts no liability for any damage to existing plaster work, decorations, flooring etc which may be consequent upon the carrying out of the work detailed. Cuts or holes made to allow for equipment will be made good but not permanently finished or re-decorated. Floor boards will be reinstated or replaced where necessary but special and/or laminated floors cannot be permanently re-fixed. Any carpets which are lifted will be re-laid to the best of our operative's ability, however, we cannot be held responsible for carpets which have been nailed or glued down. It should be anticipated that an amount of redecoration may be required and this will be the customer's responsibility and is not included in the price.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Similarly, the Company accepts no responsibility for damage which is attributable to structural defects or weaknesses unless such damage results from negligence on the part of the Company, its operatives, servants or assigns. The Company cannot be held responsible for any damage caused by a third party employed by the Customer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Where pressurised hot water systems are installed as part of the works, the customer understands this could increase the water pressure in existing plumbing. Whilst the Company will exercise reasonable care in assessing the suitability of existing systems, the Company will not be liable for any damage caused to existing plumbing installations or any consequential damage caused by the failure or incompatibility of existing installations, taps, valves, showers, other fittings or any appliances.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>You should be aware that due to the wide variety of showers available in the market place it is not possible for the Company to determine if your existing shower and any new boiler will be compatible. The Company will not be liable if your existing shower is not compatible for any reason with a new boiler.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Whilst engineers working on behalf of the Company will take reasonable care not to damage wiring, plumbing and other services at your property, the Company cannot be held responsible for any damage caused to such existing services whether the damage was caused accidentally, on purpose or because of re-routing during the installation of equipment. Where any such wiring or services are installed, it is the customer's responsibility to ensure that these be re-routed prior to commencement of the works.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The Company will not be liable for any damage to your home with is caused as a direct result of structural defects or weaknesses at the installation address whether they are visible or not. If you are unsure of the structural integrity of your building you should engage an appropriately qualified structural surveyor prior to any attendance the Company may arrange in connection with the contract.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Products and building materials can vary in colour, texture and general appearance. The Company accepts no liability for any materials used during the installation process having variations in colour, texture and general appearance. When matching materials (such as bricks and tiles) to existing materials which are part of the house, a close match is often not possible due to older products becoming obsolete and the effects of weathering over time. In summary, the Company accepts no liability for any materials introduced to the property matching any existing materials and explicitly states variations in colour, texture and general appearance are likely and will be by the customer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>When adding new equipment to your house, our engineer will need to test existing relevant infrastructure to ensure it meets current regulatory standards and is of suitable performance. Should your existing infrastructure fail to meet relevant standards then we will give you the options (and associated costs) to bring the infrastructure up to a standard which allows new equipment to be connected. If you do not wish to authorise the required additional work(s) we will leave the equipment for connection by others and will not be able to commission the equipment. In such circumstances, the customer is still liable to make payment in full as if the installation had been completed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The engineer will take pictures of your installed equipment for the Company's auditing process and for our own records. The engineer may also attend with other people including managers, supervisors, trainees or apprentices.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>During installation, our health and safety plan requires the engineer to have access to working communication devices. If for any reason the engineer is unable to get mobile phone reception, the house holder agrees to make available to the engineer access to their telephone and internet connection for no charge.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Upon completion of all physical works at the property, the customer (or their representative) may inspect the work before the engineer departs. Once the Company's appointed engineer is satisfied that the work is complete and the customer (or their representative) has been given the opportunity to inspect, then all works required to fulfil the contract are deemed to have been completed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Sometimes things do not go to plan with the installation of new equipment. The customer agrees to give the Company and its engineers reasonable opportunities to put thing right by providing access to the installation address and time to remedy any faults or problems. In addition to this, the customer undertakes to minimise or avoid any losses it may suffer as a result of the actions (or non-actions) of the Company or the appointed Engineer.</p>
                </li>

                  <p>If something within the customer's responsibilities/control (such as removal of asbestos or improving existing infrastructure) prevents delivery and/or installation of any goods/services ordered for more than 12 months after the order was placed with the Company, then the Company will be deemed to have performed the contract in full and entitled to retain all monies paid to date without deduction or refund in full or in part without the supply of any further goods/services.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>As we only supply products for domestic and private use, we are not liable for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption or business opportunity.</p>
                </li>
                <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-left: 14px;">Inspection of the site</h3>
                <li>
                  <p>The Company relies on the photos supplied by the customer during the ordering process to assess the suitability of products ordered for the customer's requirements. The customer agrees that the photos supplied during the ordering process are true and accurate images of what the engineer will see at the installation site. If, upon physical inspection of the site, it is determined that more equipment or a significant amount of extra work is required, then the Company will inform the customer of any increase in costs prior to these costs being incurred. The customer will also be informed of any delay to installation that may be incurred. If the customer declines any extra equipment or work required to facilitate the installation work they ordered, then the Company will be entitled to charge all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the aborted installation including that of any materials already supplied. The Company reserves the right to decline any order at any time up until completion. Should the Company decline an order, no damages or expenses of any kind whatsoever shall be payable by the Company to the customer beyond the refund of any money already paid in relation to the contract.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Any changes in materials and/or specifications from those detailed in the contract, will only apply when supported by an Amendment to Order document issued by the Company, which must be approved by the customer (this approval may be carried out either by physical documentation or by email).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Whilst every effort is made to ensure the delivery and installation timescales agreed during the ordering process are met, the Company reserves the right to delay installation for reasons including (for example) fires, strikes, illness, severe weather, lockouts, terrorism, war and any other causes beyond the control of the Company interfering with its execution or completion of the contract. Time shall not be deemed to be the essence of the Contract.</p>
                </li>
                <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-left: 14px;">Finance and Payments</h3>
                <li>
                  <p>Whilst every effort is made to ensure the delivery and installation timescales agreed during the ordering process are met, the Company reserves the right to delay installation for reasons including (for example) fires, strikes, illness, severe weather, lockouts, terrorism, war and any other causes beyond the control of the Company interfering with its execution or completion of the contract. Time shall not be deemed to be the essence of the Contract.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>If paying by credit or debit card, the payment of cleared funds from the customer to the Company is required prior to delivery and/or installation of goods. Payment is only deemed to have been received once the funds are showing in the Company's bank account as cleared funds. If the customer instigates an attempt to clawback payments (for example requesting a credit card chargeback) then the Company can pass on any costs and/or losses associated with dealing with and defending such action.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>All invoices issued by the Company to the customer are issued after payment has been made and goods have been installed. Whilst any money is outstanding, the Company is entitled to delay or defer any or all work without any penalty due from the Company to the customer whatsoever.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>During the order process, if the customer would prefer to pay for goods and services using a finance package, the Company may introduce the customer to a third-party finance provider.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>If you have entered a credit agreement with a finance provider the Company has introduced you to, you will need to enter a separate agreement with that provider (payment of the contract balance will be automatically processed between the Company and the Finance Provider when the balance becomes due).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>All goods supplied remain the property of the Company even though installed, by way of a lien, until fully paid for and the Company reserves the right of re-entry to remove any such goods whether fixed or otherwise, which remain unpaid for.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>All the prices we display include VAT. Delivery and other service charges will be confirmed on screen during the specification and purchase process. After the point, a customer completes an order on the Company's website, the price should not change even if the VAT rate does.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In the event of suspension or cancellation of the work at the request of the customer or lack of instructions or delay on site caused by matters beyond the control of the Company, any extra expenses thereby incurred or losses suffered shall be chargeable to the customer along with a reasonable addition for administration and overhead costs. This condition shall not be construed as to affect any statutory or common law rights of the customer.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The Company reserves the right at its sole discretion to accept or refuse any order placed by the customer until the appointed engineer has inspected the site and accepted the order.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Debris will be removed from site as part of the contract price, but this does not include the removal of any dangerous/hazardous waste material such as asbestos which we become aware of before or during the installation. It is the responsibility of the customer to arrange for the safe removal and disposal from site at their own expense and to provide the Company with a Clean Air Certificate as proof this work has been completed. A reattendance charge is payable from the customer to the Company if a reattendance is required once the dangerous/hazardous material has been removed. The customer is responsible for disposing of any packaging.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Party Wall Act; it is the responsibility of the customer to undertake a party wall agreement with any neighbouring properties where required in advance of the Company attending site to carry out work.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Under Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 the Company needs to ensure operatives working on the site have access to welfare facilities including; a toilet, washing facilities, drinking water and facilities for rest in a warm indoor area. To reduce costs the customer agrees to provide access to these facilities within the existing property for workers to use in a clean and respectful way. If the customer would like the Company to make alternative arrangements to comply with these CDM Regulations, they will notify the Company at least 21 days before any onsite works are due to commence and pay the additional cost of hiring such facilities 7 days prior to work commencing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>To confirm the installation date, the payment process (including the completion of any finance documents) needs to be finished by the customer within one hour. If the customer does not complete the payment process within an hour, the Company will endeavour to install/deliver equipment on the chosen date, however after the hour has lapsed, the company reserves the right to only offer an alternative delivery/installation slot.</p>
                </li>
                <h3 style="font-size: 25px; padding-left: 14px;">Cancellation</h3>
                <li>
                  <p>You will lose the right to cancel set out below should the Company complete the installation of your new equipment within 14 days of your order being placed and you have requested that the Company perform services within this 14-day period as it will be deemed that the Company has been engaged to carry out urgent maintenance or repairs at your household.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The customer has a right to cancel this contract within 14 days without giving any reason provided the following conditions are satisfied.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Notice of cancellation is emailed to <a href="mailto:karlweir@suffolkfm.co.uk">karlweir@suffolkfm.co.uk</a>  either before any delivery is made, or within 14 days of the order being placed.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Notice of cancellation is emailed to <a href="mailto:karlweir@suffolkfm.co.uk">karlweir@suffolkfm.co.uk</a> prior to the engineer attending site on the agreed date.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>If the equipment has already been delivered, but the engineer who will be doing the work has not yet been allocated, then the customer can cancel the order and receive a full refund less costs associated with the enhanced delivery and collection service requested to transport the equipment. For the avoidance of doubt, due to the nature of the equipment only the Company's appointed agents may transport equipment to be refunded.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>If you wish to cancel once the engineer is allocated and you are still within the 14-day cancellation period, the supply of goods will be deemed to be benefiting from enhanced delivery chosen by the customer and you will be liable for the cost of the engineer's attendance and other reasonable costs associated with both the enhanced delivery and collection arranged by the Company.
                  </p>
